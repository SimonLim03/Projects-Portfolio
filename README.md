# Portfolio - Simon (Seeyon) Lim

  


<p> 
During my academic journey, I had the opportunity to apply and enhance my technical skills through various projects, where I utilized a range of tools and technologies.

In **data analysis projects**, such as exploratory data analysis on the Google Play Store and marketing campaign analysis, I primarily used SQL and PostgreSQL for data integration, manipulation, and aggregation. After transforming and cleaning the data using SQL, I typically turned to Python or Power BI for data visualization and Python for data mining and statistical analysis. When handling large datasets, I employed big data platforms like Snowflake, Databricks, or Google Cloud Platform to efficiently process the data. For data storage and sharing, I relied on online tools such as GitHub, Streamlit, and Docker.

In **machine learning and deep learning projects**, I predominantly used Python to build various regression, classification, and neural network models. Python's extensive libraries and frameworks provided a wide array of options for developing optimal models, while also facilitating efficient data handling and manipulation.
