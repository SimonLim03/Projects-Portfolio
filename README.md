# Portfolio

  
Hello
my name is Simon Lim and I have recently graduated my Master's in Data Science at the University of Technology Sydney (UTS).



<p>I have a deep passion for understanding how things work and exploring the patterns that underlie them. My curiosity drives me to delve into diverse topics, seeking insights and solutions. I am particularly drawn to the field of data science, where professionals with varied backgrounds and skills come together to solve complex problems. What excites me most is not only solving problems but also crafting new approaches, products, and services. In my past projects, I have engaged in a wide range of data science endeavors, including developing machine learning and deep learning applications, working with NLP, processing Big Data, and creating data narratives. I am well-versed in various data science tools and clouding platform, such as Snowflake, Azure and Airflow, and have successfully implemented projects using these tools.

<p>
A machine learning product, which can predict the expected flight fare for different airport trips. In particular, this project split the travel airfare into 4 different fares, including minimum, median, modal and mean of airfare. The models with CatBoostRegressor showed a great performance and provided a comprehensive overview of potential airports fares to users. 
To enable model’s access to users, Streamlit was used for model deployment, enabling users to use the models as a application.

## Sales-Revenue-Prediction-App
<p>
This application involves two machine learning models that were established for business purposes. One model is a predictive model using a Machine Learning algorithm to accurately predict the sales revenue for a given item in a specific store at a given date.The other is a forecasting model using a time-series analysis that can forecast the total sales revenue across all stores and items for the next 7 days. Two different models helped users to get a comprehensive overviews of sales revenue across stores. The models have been deployed using Fastapi, Docker and Heroku, which enable models' access to users online anytime.

<p>
Top trending videos are evaluated based on video’s number of views, shares, likes and comments etc. A dataset with a daily record of the top popular and trending videos has been extracted through YouTube API. The objective of the project is to analyse the dataset, which consists of CSVs and Jsons files, by using a Data Lakehouse with Snowflake. Analysis of Youtube Trending Videos has helped youtube creators by providing current trending video categories and channels that have been mostly created and viewed on Youtube.
