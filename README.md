Hi there! üëã
my name is Simon Lim, a passionate data science student currently pursuing my Master's in Data Science at the University of Technology Sydney (UTS).



<p>I have a deep passion for understanding how things work and exploring the patterns that underlie them. My curiosity drives me to delve into diverse topics, seeking insights and solutions. I am particularly drawn to the field of data science, where professionals with varied backgrounds and skills come together to solve complex problems. What excites me most is not only solving problems but also crafting new approaches, products, and services. In my past projects, I have engaged in a wide range of data science endeavors, including developing machine learning and deep learning applications, working with NLP, processing Big Data, and creating data narratives. I am well-versed in various data science techniques and tools, such as Snowflake, Airflow and Databricks, and have successfully implemented projects using these tools.

## US Flight Fare Prediction App

![image](https://github.com/SimonLim03/Portfolio/assets/150989115/144020b9-79cc-40b3-bddc-f6491a81f99f)
<p>
A machine learning product, which can predict the expected flight fare for different airport trips. In particular, this project split the travel airfare into 4 different fares, including minimum, median, modal and mean of airfare Together, these metrics aim to provide a comprehensive overview of potential fares to users. To enable model‚Äôs access to users, Strealit was used for model deployment, enabling users to use the models as a application.

## Sales-Revenue-Prediction-App
<p>
This application involves two machine learning models that were established for business purposes. One model is a predictive model using a Machine Learning algorithm to accurately predict the sales revenue for a given item in a specific store at a given date. The other is a forecasting model using a time-series analysis that can forecast the total sales revenue across all stores and items for the next 7 days. The models have been deployed using Fastapi, Docker and Heroku, which enable models' access to users online anytime.

<p>
Top trending videos are evaluated based on video‚Äôs number of views, shares, likes and comments etc. A dataset with a daily record of the top popular and trending videos has been extracted through YouTube API. The objective of the project is to analyse the dataset, which consists of CSVs and Jsons files, by using a Data Lakehouse with Snowflake.

<p>
Airbnb records millions of various information in 191 countries, including density of rentals across regions, price variations across rentals and host-guest interactions (e.g., number of reviews). In this project, only data in Sydney are used with specific date range from May 2020 to April 2021. The objective of the project is to build production-ready data pipelines with Airflow, Data Build Tool and Postgres SQL.

## Covid-19-NLP-text-analysis
<p>
This project conducts text analysis using various techniques, including word count, word frequency, word association, k-mean clustering and sentiment analysis on dataset that is associated with the COVID-19 vaccine expressions and will try to find out the narrative and insights of the dataset. The dataset involves a variety of expressions for 181 common questions about COVID-19 vaccine.

<p>
Online reviews are important for customers for a better understanding of the product and their purchasing decisions. Reviews can also help retailers to improve their service or product. This project aims to use NLP techniques to build prediction models to predict how helpful new reviews will be or gain insight into the features that influence helpfulness. To better understand the variety of NLP techniques, multiple NLP techniques have been used.
